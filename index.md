That is a stack of pancakes. These pancakes were casualties in the 1857 war of the Pancake People vs their Bacon opressors. it was brutal. Syrup was shed everywhere. As were bacon bits. It was a very grim time in the anthropomorphic food land, indeed. Many other species, such as the not too distant sausage people & their allies in broccoli land were worried about if the world would be overtaken by this oppresive bacon-ruled communist regime. But alas! The pancake folk fought hard. This website exists to celebrate the freedom that they fought long and hard for. May we therefore eat today the pancake stacks of the fallen brothers and sisters who dedicated their lives to this nobel cause.
